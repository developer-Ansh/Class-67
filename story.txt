    Harry's parents were killed by Lord Voldemort on Harry's 1st Birthday. So Professor Dumbledore ordered Hagrid
to safely take Harry to his Aunty's place Privet Drive 9, after that Harry grew up and he still doesn't know 
that his parents were murdered. But at his 11th Birthday when his Hogwarts letter arrived Hagrid told him the
whole story.

    Than Harry admissioned at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy, he made two best Friends named
Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger and they toghether defeated Lord Voldemort in a Huge Magic War,
And Harry's last spell at war was "Avada Kedavara.....".
